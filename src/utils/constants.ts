  # GDSC Solutions Challenge
  ***

  ## The hardest part is getting started.
  ### What if?
  - There were no limits to your ideas? 
  - Technological constraints didn’t exist?
  - You could have an impact with just the resources available to you?

  ### Advice from winners.
  - Just start moving in a direction, you’ll learn along the way (don’t over plan!).
  - You don’t have to solve the world’s problems, just one that’s meaningful to you.
  - You don’t need the perfectly technical team, just a group that’s inspired and dedicated.

# FAQs

### Can my solution solve a problem outside of the scope of the 17 Sustainable Developer Goals?

For Solution Challenge 2023, we require your submitted solution to solve for at least one or more of the 17 SDGs. When you have submitted your solution, please review all the 17 SDGs to understand which SDG your solution is focused on and what SDG targets you are looking to solve for. 

### Can one student or team submit with multiple submissions if they’ve contributed to both projects?

The Terms and Conditions state “LIMIT ONE (1) ENTRY PER PERSON,” so each student can only be a part of one submission.



### Can I still participate in the Solution Challenge if there is no Google Developer Student Club at my university?

Yes, as a student you can still participate as long as you team up with **at least one** student at an existing GDSC university. You must join that GDSC community through the GDSC event platform. We recommend you to then reach out to the GDSC lead for guidance on how to join or form a team with their community.



### Given the implications of social distancing, our ability to test with users was impacted -- will the judges consider this?

Our judges will surely be mindful of the limitations that have been added by COVID-19. This includes but is not limited to:
- Ability to meet as a team
- Ability to have users test the solution
- Lack of internet access or proper developer environments due to displacement from your college campus.
