  # GDSC Solutions Challenge 2023

  ***

  ## The hardest part is getting started.
  ### What if?
  - There were no limits to your ideas? 
  - Technological constraints didn’t exist?
  - You could have an impact with just the resources available to you?

  ### Advice from winners.
  - Just start moving in a direction, you’ll learn along the way (don’t over plan!).
  - You don’t have to solve the world’s problems, just one that’s meaningful to you.
  - You don’t need the perfectly technical team, just a group that’s inspired and dedicated.

# FAQs

### Can my solution solve a problem outside of the scope of the 17 Sustainable Developer Goals?

For Solution Challenge 2023, we require your submitted solution to solve for at least one or more of the 17 SDGs. When you have submitted your solution, please review all the 17 SDGs to understand which SDG your solution is focused on and what SDG targets you are looking to solve for. 

### Can one student or team submit with multiple submissions if they’ve contributed to both projects?

The Terms and Conditions state “LIMIT ONE (1) ENTRY PER PERSON,” so each student can only be a part of one submission.



### Can I still participate in the Solution Challenge if there is no Google Developer Student Club at my university?

Yes, as a student you can still participate as long as you team up with **at least one** student at an existing GDSC university. You must join that GDSC community through the GDSC event platform. We recommend you to then reach out to the GDSC lead for guidance on how to join or form a team with their community.



### Given the implications of social distancing, our ability to test with users was impacted -- will the judges consider this?

Our judges will surely be mindful of the limitations that have been added by COVID-19. This includes but is not limited to:
- Ability to meet as a team
- Ability to have users test the solution
- Lack of internet access or proper developer environments due to displacement from your college campus.

# What past participants said

### Android
“Developing an Android app from Android Studio is so easy and enjoyable. Android Studio's new features, including Flash Run and ConstraintLayout, help us to build our app faster, easier, and better. We develop our app with the aid of Google's CodeLabs, which are so useful and easy to follow.”

### Flutter

“Flutter helped us to become more productive. It helped me to build these apps with less code, and less worrying about the basic features. The Hot Reload features saved a lot of my time.”

### Google Cloud Platform
“GCP allows the apps to be 100% deployable on the cloud. With that vast features available and readily available integration of machine learning online, GCP allows us to be ready for every stage of deployment, ultimately worldwide deployment at multiple regions in multiple countries.”

### Firebase
“I loved Firebase more because of its easiness and scalability and the approaches that we can do. It's smooth, fast and amazing. It made me say goodbye to SQL and move towards the NOSQL database as it's more robust, easy to use and powerful.”

### TensorFlow
“TensorFlow is one of the open source tools we use to perform supervised learning for detection. TensorFlow is a really easy tool to use to get started. We chose to use TensorFlow because it is easy to build neural networks using it. It has a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries and community resources that lets researchers push the state-of-the-art in ML and helps developers to easily build and deploy ML powered applications.”
