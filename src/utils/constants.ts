  # GDSC Solutions Challenge

  ***

  ### The hardest part is getting started.
  There were no limits to your ideas? 
  Technological constraints didn’t exist?
  You could have an impact with just the resources available to you?

  ### Advice from winners.
  Just start moving in a direction, you’ll learn along the way (don’t over plan!).
  You don’t have to solve the world’s problems, just one that’s meaningful to you.
  You don’t need the perfectly technical team, just a group that’s inspired and dedicated.
